# observatools

Useful tools to have during (or before) observing runs.
Current codes:

    - `coralie_formatter`: Given an input files with object names, RA, DEC, V magnitude, period and 
      priority number, it spits out a formatted list that can be loaded in the observing program at the 
      1.2m Swiss telescope.

    - `quickphot`: Given positions (in pixels) of a target and a comparison star, it gets quick photometry 
      along with postage stamps of the target, the comparison and the used aperture.
